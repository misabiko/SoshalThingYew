Tweetdeck-style timeline app to display feeds from various services in columns.

Mostly for my personal use, so the code is messy and the UI is all over the place. ðŸ˜Š

## Why I use it (vs Tweetdeck)
- Not having every image cropped
- Mark posts as read and hide them as I read
- Having multiple sources per timeline rather than 15 individual ones
- Multi column timelines
- Adding timelines to other websites
- Using it for other services than Twitter (not quite there yet)

## Usage

### Dev
Serve the app  on `localhost:8080` with `cargo run -p utils --bin server`  
Needs a `credentials.json` in the working directory with `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret` for a Twitter app.  
That or setting `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret` as environment variables.  

If not using any endpoints with proxy `trunk serve` should work too.

### Release

To deploy, only `server.exe`, `dist/` folder and `credentials.json` or environment variables are needed.
